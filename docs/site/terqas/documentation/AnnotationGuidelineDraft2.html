Introduction</H2><P>This document describes the initial annotation guidelines formarking up text according to the TimeML language. It puts together all the modifications and additions discussedso far and gives us the tag specifications that follow for a first passat TimeML. </P><p>For the sake of convenience, I&amp;P(02) will be used to refer to Ingria and Pustejovsky (2002),and TIDES(02), to Ferro et al. (2002) throughout the whole document. <H2><a NAME="2 Explanation of TimeML Tags"></a>2. Explanation of TimeML Tags and their Attributes</H2><H3><a NAME="2.1 The tag &lt;EVENT&gt;"></a>2.1 The tag &lt;EVENT&gt;</H3><P>We will consider events a cover term for situations that <I>happen</I> or<I>occur</I>. Events can be punctual (1-2) or last for a period of time (3-4):</P><ol><i><li>Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese explorer, first <B>reached</B>  the islands in search of spices. <BR><li>A fresh flow of lava, gas and debris <B>erupted</B> there Saturday.<li>Businesses <b>are emerging</B> on the Internet so quickly  that no one, including government regulators, can keep track  of them. <li>11,024 people, including local Aeta aborigines, <b>were  evacuated</B> to 18 disaster relief centers.</i></ol><P>We will consider also as events those predicates describing<I>states</I> or <I>circumstances</I> in which something obtainsor holds true. However, they will be annotated only in caseswhere they are identifiably changed over the course of the documentbeing marked up. For instance, in the following example, in theexpression <I>the Aeroflot Airbus</I> the relationship indicatingthat the Airbus is run and operated by Aeroflot is not a Statein the desired sense. Rather, because it is persistent throughoutthe event line of the document, we factor it out and it is notmarked up. On the other hand, properties that are known to changeduring the events represented/reported in an article will be markedas States, as illustrated below. So, assume for now that events haveonly an id attribute:</P><BLOCKQUOTE>  <PRE>All 75 people&lt;EVENT stid=1&gt;on board&lt;/EVENT&gt;the Aeroflot Airbus&lt;EVENT eid=5&gt;died&lt;/EVENT&gt;</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE><H4><a NAME="2.1.1 How to annotate EVENTs"></a>2.1.1 How to annotate EVENTs</H4><P>Events are generally expressed by means of tensed and untensed verbs (1 and 2), nominalizations (3), adjectives (4), predicative clauses (5), or prepositional phrases (6): <ol><i><li> A fresh flow of lava, gas and debris <b>erupted</b> there Saturday.<li> Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the prime minister ofthe Netherlands <b>to thank</b> him for thousands of gas masks his countryhas already contributed.<li> Israel will ask the United States to delay amilitary <b>strike</b> against Iraq until the Jewish state is fullyprepared for a possible Iraqi <b>attack</b>.<li> ... after a Philippine volcano <b>dormant</b> for six centuries began exploding withsearing gases, thick ash and deadly debris.<li>"There is no reason why we would not <b>be prepared</b>," Mordechaitold the Yediot Ahronot daily.<li> All 75 people <b>on board</b> the Aeroflot Airbus died.</i> </ol>   The annotation of formally simple events is straightforward (examples 1, 3 and 4 above):<pre>A fresh flow of lava, gas and debris &lt;EVENT eid=1&gt;erupted&lt;/EVENT&gt;there Saturday.</pre>However, formally complex events may be sequentally discontinuous in some contexts:<ol><I><li>There is no reason why we would not <b>be prepared.</b> <br> There is no reason why we would not <b>be</b> fully <b>prepared.</b><br><br><li>They will definitely <b>take into consideration</b> our readiness.<br>They will definitely <b>take</b> it <b>into consideration</b>. </i></ol>In order to avoid problems derived from tagging material of diverse    scope, employ the following strategies:<ul><li> If the event is expressed by a verbal cluster, the EVENT tag will be applied to the head of the cluster:<blockquote><I>Israel &nbsp;&nbsp;<u>has been <b>scrambling</b></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>to <b>buy</b></u>&nbsp;&nbsp; more masks abroad.</i></blockquote> <li>If the main predicate is a phrasal verb, only the verbal part (and not its preposition) will be marked:<blockquote><I>Additional distribution centers would be &nbsp;&nbsp;<u><B>set</B> up</u>&nbsp;&nbsp; next week.</i></blockquote>  <li> If the event is a nominalization which appears as the head of the NP along with other elements (specifiers, complements, modifiers), only the nominalization element will be marked:<blockquote><I><u>The young industry's rapid <b>growth</b></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;also is attracting regulators eager to police its many facets.</i></blockquote>  <li> If the event is a nominalization accompained by some sort of	light predicate (e.g., see below), we will tag both elements. <blockquote><I>Several pro-Iraq &nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>demonstrations</b> have <b>taken</b> place</u>&nbsp;&nbsp; in the last week.<br>They will definitely &nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>take</b> into	      <b>consideration</b></u>&nbsp;&nbsp; our readiness. </i></blockquote> This proposal takes into consideration the relevance of both verbal and nominal headswrt the different kind of eventive information they convey. The two tagged eventswill be related as IDENTICAL by the 'relType' attribute in the LINK tag (see section 2.5).<br><br><li> If the event is a predicative clause, only the predicative element (the adjective in the following examples) will be tagged:<br><blockquote><I>There is no reason why we &nbsp;&nbsp;<u>would not be <b>prepared</b></u>. <br>If, in spite of everything, we &nbsp;&nbsp;<u>will not be <b>ready</b></u>,&nbsp;&nbsp; we will ask the United States to delay the operation.</i></blockquote> <li> Finally, if the event is expressed by means of a prepositional phrase,only the nominal head will be tagged:<blockquote><I>All 75 people &nbsp;&nbsp;<u>on <b>board</b></u>&nbsp;&nbsp; the Aeroflot Airbus died.</i></blockquote> </ul>  </P><H4><a NAME="2.1.2 Attributes for EVENTs"></a>2.1.2 Attributes for EVENT</H4><H4>a.  Event ID number (eid)</h4>Non-optional attribute. Each event has to be identified by an ID number.This will be automatically assigned by the annotation tool every time an EVENT tag is assigned to some string.<H4>b.  Class</H4><P>Non-optional attribute. Each event belongs to one of the followingclasses:</P><UL>  <LI>STATE: <BR>  As defined above, states describe <I>circumstances</I> in which  something obtains or holds true. We will only annotate those  that are not persistent through the document being marked. Additional  examples, in addition to those given above: <blockquote><I>Israel  has been scrambling to buy more masks abroad, after a <B>shortage</B>  of several hundred thousand gas masks, including those for young  children, was discovered. <BR>  &quot;There is no reason why we would not be <B>prepared</B>,&quot;  Mordechai told the Yediot Ahronot daily. <BR>  No <B>injuries</B> were reported over the weekend. <BR>  The agencies fear they will be <B>unable</B> to crack those codes  to eavesdrop on spies and crooks. </I></blockquote>  <LI>REPORTING: <BR>  Reporting events describe the action of a person or an organization  declaring something, narrating an event, informing about an event,  etc.   <br>E.g.,   <blockquote>  <I>Punongbayan <B>said</B> that the 4,795-foot-high volcano was  spewing gases up to 1,800 degrees. <BR>  No injuries were <B>reported</B> over the weekend. </I></blockquote>  <LI>ASPECTUAL: <BR>  In languages such as English and French, there is a grammatical  device of aspectual predication, which focuses on four facets  of the event history: <BR><BR>  a. Initiation: <I>begin</I>, <I>start</I>, <i>commence, set out, set 	  about, lead off, originate, initiate</i>.<BR>  b. Termination: <I>stop</I>, <I>end</I>, <i>halt</i>,	<i>terminate</i>, <i>cease</i>, <i> discontinue</i>, <i>interrupt</i>,	<i>quit</i>, <i>give up</i>, <i>abandon</i>, <i>block</i>,	<i>break</i>, <i>lay off</i>. <BR>  c. Completion: <I>finish</I>, <I>complete</I>. <BR>  d. Continuation: <I>continue</I>, <I>keep, go on, proceed, go along, 	  carry on, uphold, bear on, persist, persevere.</I> <BR>    <p>A couple of examples:  <blockquote><I>The volcano <b>began</B> showing  signs of activity in April for the first time in 600 years,...  <br>all non-essential personnel should <b>begin</b>evacuating the sprawling base.  </i></blockquote>   <P>Here, a member of a closed class of predicates is able to  select a verbal or nominal complement as an argument and mark  that event with the function (designation) associated with one  of the facets above. See the section on the LINK tag for the  annotation of the relation between the 2 events.<BR><br>  <li>INTENDING:<BR>  Currently we will consider the class of Intending Events as a class	that includes the following different kinds of verbal predicates:  	  <BR><br>	    <UL>  <LI><B>Intensional events:  </B>  Those events describing &quot;world-creating&quot;  predicates. That is, events that introduce complements that can  be regarded as referring to alternative or possible worlds.  <P>Some examples are: <I>believe, think, expect, suspect, fear,  want, hope, appear, seem</I> etc.   <blockquote><I>&quot;We're  <B>expecting</B> a major eruption,&quot; he said in a telephone  interview early today. <BR>   The agencies <B>fear</B> they will be unable to crack those codes  to eavesdrop on spies and crooks. </I></blockquote>    We consider  as Intensional Events also those &quot;world-creating&quot; predicates  that can be regarded as states. Therefore they will not be   classified as STATES:     <blockquote><I>It is <B>conceivable</B>  that a larger eruption will take place in few hours. <BR>  He said he was <B>sure</B> that a larger eruption would happen.  </I></blockquote>    See section 2.5 about how to relate the Intensional Event and the event  that it introduces as its complement. <BR><BR>  <LI><B>Extensional events: </B>  Extensional events are similar to Intensional ones in the sense  that they introduce an argument describing an event that has  not happened yet. The difference between the two classes of events  is, however, that in this second case the event is describing  a particular action that is being applied in order to have some  effect on the argument (to bring it  about, to postpone it, to avoid it, and so forth). <BR>  Some of the possible predicates here are: <I>delay, postpone,  cancel, avoid, push, scramble, try, attempt, </I>etc.  <blockquote><I>Companies such as Microsoft or a combined worldcom  MCI are <B>trying</B> to monopolize Internet access. <BR>  Israel will ask the United States to <B>delay</B> a military  strike against Iraq. <BR>  Israel has been <B>scrambling</B> to buy more masks abroad. </I></blockquote>    <BR>  <LI><B>Explicit performative events:</B> Verbal predicates like <I>promise,  agree, offer, ask,</I>, etc.. They may introduce a similar relation  with their eventive argument to the one observed with the so-called	    Intensional and Extensional Events.  <br>E.g.,   <blockquote><I>Germany has  <B>agreed</B> to lend<B>/(irrealis)</B> Israel 180,000 protective  kits against chemical and biological weapons, and Switzerland  <B>offered</B> to lend<B>/(irrealis)</B> Israel another 25,000  masks. <BR>  They were <B>ordered</B> to take<B>/(irrealis)</B> along important  papers. </I></blockquote>  </ul>	      <LI>OCCURRENCE: <BR>  This class includes all other kinds of events describing something  that happens or occurs in the world. Some examples are given as illustration:  <blockquote><I>The Defense Ministry said 16 planes have  <B>landed</B> so far with protective equipment against biological  and chemical warfare. <BR>  Mordechai said all the gas masks from abroad would <B>arrive</B>  soon and be <B>distributed</B> to the public, adding that  additional distribution centers would be <B>set</B> up next week.<BR>  Two moderate <B>eruptions</B> shortly before 3 p.m. Sunday appeared  to <B>signal</B> a larger <B>explosion</B>. </I></blockquote></UL><H4>c.  Tense</H4><P>Non-optional attribute. Given that the verbal tense is a valuable information in determiningthe temporal ordering of a related set of events, we will annotateit wherever it occurs. Indeed, it doesn't apply to nominalizationsand non-finite clauses. In this case, the appropriate value willbe 'NONE' (see below). The possible values for 'Tense' are:</P><UL>  <LI>PAST:   <blockquote><I>  No injuries were <B>reported</B> over the weekend. <BR>  Villagers from a 12-mile radius of the mountain <B>fled</B> the  area on foot </I></blockquote>  <LI>PRESENT:   <blockquote><i>The young industry's rapid growth also  is <B>attracting</B> regulators eager to police its many facets.<BR>  The agencies <B>fear</B> they will be unable to crack those codes  to eavesdrop on spies and crooks.</i>  </blockquote>  <LI>FUTURE: <blockquote><I>&quot;Anything along its path will  be <B>destroyed</B>.&quot; <BR>  The agencies fear they will be <B>unable</B> to crack those codes  to eavesdrop on spies and crooks. </I></blockquote>  <LI>IRREALIS:<blockquote><I>Germany has  agreed to <B>lend</B> Israel 180,000 protective  kits against chemical and biological weapons, and Switzerland  offered to <B>lend</B> Israel another 25,000  masks. <BR>  They were ordered to <B>take</B> along important  papers. </I></blockquote><p>Note here that the irrealis character of the event depends upon the	  situation being described and not on the formal features of	  the verbal predicate. <br><br>  <LI>NONE: Specifically for nominalizations, non-finite clauses and adjectives:  <blockquote><I>  The <B>evacuation</B> was to take four hours, he said. <BR>  Officials ordered local Americans to <B>pack</B> bags and <B>rehearse</B>  evacuation procedures. </I></blockquote></UL>    <H4>d.  Aspect</H4><P>Optional attribute. Whenever possible, we will mark whetherthe aspect of the verb is perfective or progressive.</P><UL>  <LI>PERFECTIVE:   <blockquote><I>Philippines officials earlier  had <B>ordered</B> the evacuation of more than 11,000 people.<BR>  Anything along its path will be <b>destroyed</B>. </I></blockquote>    <LI>PROGRESSIVE:   <blockquote><I>The volcano began <B>showing</B>  signs of activity in April for the first time in 600 years,...<BR>  The young industry's rapid growth also is <B>attracting</B> regulators  eager to police its many facets. </I></blockquote></UL><H4>e.  Polarity</H4><P>Non-optional attribute. Two values are possible here:<ul><li>POSITIVE:  <blockquote><I>Villagers from a 12-mile radius of the mountain <b>fled</b> the area on foot.<br>All 75 people on board the Aeroflot Airbus <b>died</b>. <br>	  </I></blockquote><li>NEGATIVE:  <blockquote><I>    "There is no reason why we would not be <b>prepared</b>," Mordechai told	    the Yediot Ahronot daily.     <br>No <b>injuries</b> were reported over the weekend.	        <br>Palestinian police preventeda planned pro-Iraq <b>rally</b> by the Palestinian Professionals' Union.	  </I></blockquote></ul> <H4><a NAME="2.1.3 BNF for the EVENT tag"></a>2.1.3 BNF for the EVENT tag</H4><PRE>attributes ::= eid class tense [aspect] polarityeid ::= &lt;integer&gt;class ::= 'OCCURRENCE' |'STATE' | 'REPORTING' | 'ASPECTUAL' | 'INTENDING'tense ::= 'PAST' | 'PRESENT' | 'FUTURE' | 'IRREALIS' | 'NONE'aspect ::= 'PROGRESSIVE' | 'PERFECTIVE'polarity ::= 'POSITIVE' | 'NEGATIVE' </PRE><H4><a NAME="2.1.4 Complete annotation of some of the previous examples"></a>2.1.4 Complete annotation of some of the previous examples</H4><ol><li><i>The young industry's rapid growth also is attracting regulatorseager to police its many facets.</i><pre>The young industry's rapid&lt;EVENT eid=1 class=OCCURRENCE tense=NONE polarity=POSITIVE&gt; growth &lt;/EVENT&gt;also is &lt;EVENT eid=2 class=OCCURRENCE tense=PRESENT aspect=PROGRESSIVE polarity=POSITIVE&gt; attracting &lt;/EVENT&gt;regulators &lt;EVENT eid=4 class=STATE polarity=POSITIVE&gt;eager &lt;/EVENT&gt;to&lt;EVENT eid=5 class=OCCURRENCE tense=IRREALIS polarity=POSITIVE&gt; police &lt;/EVENT&gt;its many facets.</pre><li><i>Several pro-Iraq demonstrations have taken place in the last week.</i><pre>Several pro-Iraq &lt;EVENT eid=1 class=OCCURRENCE tense=NONE polarity=POSITIVE&gt; demonstrations &lt;/EVENT&gt;have &lt;EVENT eid=2 class=OCCURRENCE tense=PAST aspect=PERFECTIVE polarity=POSITIVE&gt; taken &lt;/EVENT&gt;place in the last week. </pre><li> A fresh flow of lava, gas and debris <b>erupted</b> there Saturday.<li> Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the prime minister ofthe Netherlands <b>to thank</b> him for thousands of gas masks his countryhas already contributed.<li> Israel will ask the United States to delay amilitary <b>strike</b> against Iraq until the Jewish state is fullyprepared for a possible Iraqi <b>attack</b>.<li> ... after a Philippine volcano <b>dormant</b> for six centuries began exploding withsearing gases, thick ash and deadly debris.<li>"There is no reason why we would not <b>be prepared</b>," Mordechaitold the Yediot Ahronot daily.<li> All 75 people <b>on board</b> the Aeroflot Airbus died.<li>11,024 people, including local Aeta aborigines, were evacuated  to 18 disaster relief centers <B>set</B> up at area schools.</ol><br><br><H3><a NAME="2.2 The tag &lt;TIMEX3&gt;"></a>2.2   The tag &lt;TIMEX3&gt;</H3>Since the exact nature of the tag that TimeML uses to annotate temporal expressions is different in detail both from the TIMEX tag in STAG and the TIMEX2 tag in TIDES, we have decided to rename it TIMEX3. See I&amp;P(02) for furtherdetails.<p><b>(WARNING: This section is subject to revision. Most of the specificationsgiven here require common agreement. The section has been based on TIDES(02) treatmentof temporal expressions. However, a deeper study of that document, and the corresponding tunning of the current section, is still required.)</b> <H4><a NAME="2.2.1 How to annotate TIMEX3s"></a>2.2.1 How to annotate TIMEX3s</H4><p>In order to be as much compliant as possible with TIDES TIMEX2 annotation,the TIMEX3 tag will be applied to TIMEX2 markable expressions. See TIDES(02) for detailed informationabout the particular expressions we intend to cover. <p>However, TimeML will differ from TIDES in the following issues (the examples given below are adapted from TIDES(02)):<ol><li> <b>Extent of the timeexpression to tag</b> (issue covered in TIDES(02), section 4.4.3).  <br>Contrary to the policy followed in the mentioned document, TIMEX3 will not include any of the following pre- and post-modifiers of the time expression:     <ul>        <br>        <li> <b>Determiners</b>: <i>a, the, that</i>, etc., as in <i>that day,         next day, a year ago</i>.        <br>        <br>        <li> <b>Premodifiers that qualify as TIMEX2 MOD attributes</b>:            <br>            <ul>             <br>                <li>Quantifier modifiers in general: <i>approximately, more than,                 no more than, less than, </i> etc.                <br><br>                <li>Lexicalized aspect markers: <i>early, start (of), middle, mid-, late,</i> etc.                  </ul>                        <p>See TIDES(02), appendix C, for a detailed list of these elements.              <p>We want to separate these elements from the time expression in order to            avoid potential problems with expressions like <i>early last month</i> or            <i>at least last week</i>. TimeML marks <i>last</i> as a SIGNAL            (see section 2.4).            Considering then the TIMEX2 MOD markable element (<i>early, at least</i>)             as part of the time expression would cause a fragmented sequence:                        <pre>            early   &lt;TIMEX3 eid=1&gt;   (part I)            last    &lt;SIGNAL&gt;            month   &lt;TIMEX3 eid=1&gt;   (part II)            </pre>             That problem doesn't seem to apply to temporal expressions with             quantifier modifiers. However, we keep them separated from the TIMEX3             markable string in order            to facilitate a straightforward translation from TIDES TIMEX2 to TimeML TIMEX3.            <p>            We will annotate TIMEX2 MOD markable elements as SIGNALS (section 2.4 below).             Such treatment, together with the introduction of TEMPORAL FUNCTIONs              (section 2.6), guarantees a more compositional approach            and thus ensures a better process of reasoning.                             <br> <br>               <li> <b>Other premodifiers, which don't qualify as TIMEX2 MOD attributes</b>,         like: <i>first, last, coming,             next, previous, current, present(adj.), futur(adj.), past(adj.)  </i>, etc.            That is, premodifiers that act as applying a temporal function over the             TIMEX3 expression (see section 2.6).                        <p>Again, this treatment is fundamental in order to ensure the reasoning             capability of the system.                             <br><br>        <li> <b>Postmodifiers</b>, including prepositional phrases and dependent clauses.         So contrary to what is specified in TIDES(02), in the following examples        the postmodifiers in brackets are not part of the temporal expression         but introduce, in some cases, a related event. The annotation adopted in TimeML        for these examples is provided below each instance.                <blockquote>        <i>five days (after he came back)        </i>        <pre>        ***        </pre>        <i>the future (of our peoples)        </i>        <pre>        </pre>        <i>nearly four decades (of experience)        </i>        <pre>        </pre>        <i>months (of renewed hostility)        </i>        <pre>        </pre>        <i>a historic day (for the European enterprise)        </i>        <pre>        </pre>        <i>the second-best quarter (ever)        </i>        <pre>        </pre>        <i>        </i>        <pre>        </pre>        </blockquote>    </ul>    <li><b>Treatment of complex temporal expressions</b> (corresponding to section 4.4.4 in TIDES(02)).<br>TIDES establishes different treatments for complex temporal expressions. In some cases, a unique tagis annotated. In some others, there is the possibility ofembedding TIMEX2 tags. This is however not necessary in TimeML, given the availability of TEMPORAL FUNCTIONs and the LINK tag, which allow relating different time expressions. The treatment for complex temporal expressions in TimeML is as shown below:<ul><br><li> <b>A unique TIMEX3 tag</b> will be assigned to expressions like those in TIDES(02), section 4.4.4 (<i>When to Create One Tag</i>). The annotator is referedto there for specific details on the structure of this sequences.  Some of the examples are given here:<blockquote><i>twelve o'clock midnight<br>Friday evening<br>Tuesday the 18th<br>twelve o'clock January 3, 1984<br><br>the second of December<br>October of 1963<br>summer of 1964<br>eleven in the morning</i></blockquote>Note that in <i>the second of December</i> the article won't be annotated as partof the temporal expression. On the other hand, <i>second</i> should be included in it(and not treated as a SIGNAL) since it is interpretred differently from the use of <i>second</i> in <i>the second week of July</i>,where the ordinal is a modifier of <i>week</i>. <br><br><li> <b>There will be no embedded tags</b> for complex temporal expressions (cf.TIDES(02), p.16), but two TIMEX3 tags, related by means of a TEMPORAL FUNCTION or LINK tag. TIDES uses embedded tags for two differentcases:<br><br><ol><li>"When the text segment is a temporal expression that explicitlyexpresses a temporal sequence, and the anchoring phrase is itself a time expression":<blockquote><i>I'm leaving on vacation <B>two weeks from next Tuesday</B>.<br>A major earthquake struck Los Angeles <B>three years ago today</B>.</i></blockquote>TimeML will annotate each of these temporal-denoting strings as having two temporal expressions(<i>two weeks</i> and <i>Tuesday</i>, and <i>three years</i> and <i>today</i>), which arerelated by means of a FUNCTION tag. The mark-up for the first instance would be as follows:<pre>***</pre><li>"In a possessive construction, if both the possessive phrase and the phrase that it modifies aretemporal expressions"<blockquote><i><b>This year's summer</b> was unusually hot.</i></blockquote>In this case, the tag relating the two temporal expressions (<i>year</i>and <i>summer</i>) is of type LINK:<pre>***</pre></ol> <li> Similarly, <b>multiple TIMEX3 tags related by a LINK tag</b> will be applied to handle "cases other than those describedabove, temporal phrases that appear in close proximity are tagged as independent phrases":<blockquote><i>I tutored an English student some Thursdays in 1998.</i><pre></pre><br><i>The concert is at 8:00 p.m. on Friday.</i><pre></pre><br><i>The concert is Friday at 8:00 p.m.</i><pre></pre></blockquote></ul></ol>    <p>Some examples of TIMEX3 markable expressions are the following:<ol><li>Dates and/or times:<blockquote><i>October 1, 1999<br>9 a.m. Friday, October 1, 1999<br>Fall 1999<br>ten minutes to three</i></blockquote><li>Strict indexicals: <blockquote><i>now, nowadays, yesterday, currently, tomorrow, lately,</i> etc. </blockquote>That is, tokens that occupy the entire value of VAL in TIDESguidelines (see TIDES(02), appendix B2), with the exception of the adjectives <i>current, present, future, past, former, late,</i> etc., which will betagged as signals so that the appropriate temporal functions can be applied.<br><br><li>All these kinds of expressions may appear in temporal expressions with Appositives(1), Range Expressions (2) or Conjoined Expressions (3):<br><br><ol><i><li>I'm a creature of the 1960s, the days of free love.<li>She served as Canada’s ambassador to the U.N. from 1992 through 1995.<li>The prime minister's visit is to run August 6-8.</i></ol> <p>The annotation strategy that will be applied to them is exactly as detailed TIDES(02), p. 14.</ol><p>At the present moment it is still pending a deep analysis of how much we want to benefit from TIDES annotation guidelines.
